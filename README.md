#Connect4Wins 
is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. 
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color consecutively vertically, 
horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

This repository contains the source code for a GUI-based implementation of the Connect4Wins game written in Java. It provides a simple and interactive way for users to enjoy the game.
